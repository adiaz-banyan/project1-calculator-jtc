# JTC Project 1: Calculator

## Summary:
### User inputs the total bill, the number of people the bill will be split by if any, and the percentage of the tip they will reveive.

> Here I create what I believe to be a working tip(_like a tip for a waiter? Almost created entire calculator with working frontend since no instructions were given as to what the calculator wants. But at the very end I saw the instructions that told me what needed to be done. At the end._) calculator. Not entirely sure but from a js dev view, I would say that I'm using Flask to create the client facing site, using python to both render the site and handle event listeners (i.e. onclick, onmouseover, etc..). We could also say that we use python to communicate with external resources like databases and stuff. Not here of course but when we do.
